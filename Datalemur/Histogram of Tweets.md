###  Histogram of Tweets
Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group..
  

 


### Solution Query

```SELECT 
  tweet_count_per_user AS tweet_bucket, 
  COUNT(user_id) AS users_num 
FROM (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count_per_user 
  FROM tweets 
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' 
    AND '2022-12-31'
  GROUP BY user_id) AS total_tweets 
GROUP BY tweet_count_per_user;
```
