However, you should only include product and months combination where the sales have consistently increased from 2022 to 2023 and from 2023 to 2024, display the output in ascending order of product_id.

```sql
with cte as (
select product_id, MONTH(order_date) AS order_month
,YEAR(order_date) AS order_year
,SUM(sales) AS sales
from orders
group by product_id,MONTH(order_date) ,YEAR(order_date)
)
,cte2 as (
select product_id,order_month
, sum(case when order_year='2022' then sales else 0 end) as sales_2022 
, sum(case when order_year='2023' then sales else 0 end) as sales_2023
, sum(case when order_year='2024' then sales else 0 end) as sales_2024
from cte
group by product_id,order_month
)
select * 
from cte2
where sales_2024>sales_2023 and sales_2023>sales_2022
ORDER BY product_id; ;
