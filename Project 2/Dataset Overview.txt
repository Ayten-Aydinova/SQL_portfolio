Dataset Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing Olympic data, including athletes, their performances, and the details of medals won. The dataset consists of two tables:

Table 1: Athlete Details

ATHLETE_ID: Unique identifier for athletes.
GAMES: The name of the Olympic games.
YEAR: Year of the games.
SEASON: Indicates Summer or Winter Olympics.
CITY: Host city of the games.
SPORT: The category of the sport.
EVENT: Specific event within the sport.
MEDAL: Type of medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
Table 2: Athlete Demographics

ID: Identifier matching ATHLETE_ID.
NAME: Athlete's name.
SEX: Gender of the athlete.
HEIGHT: Athlete's height.
WEIGHT: Athlete's weight.
TEAM: Country or team represented by the athlete.
Purpose
This project aims to showcase SQL skills by analyzing Olympic data to uncover insights about athletes, teams, and events.

Key Analyses

Identified the team that has won the maximum gold medals over the years.
Calculated total silver medals won by each team and determined the year in which each team won the most silver medals.
Found the player with the maximum gold medals among those who have won only gold medals (never silver or bronze).
Identified the player(s) with the maximum gold medals in each year, handling ties with a comma-separated list.
Determined the event and year in which India won its first gold, silver, and bronze medals.
Found players who won gold medals in both Summer and Winter Olympics.
Identified players who won gold, silver, and bronze medals in a single Olympics, listing their names and the year.
Highlighted players who won gold medals in the same event in three consecutive Summer Olympics, starting from 2000.
Skills Demonstrated

Advanced SQL techniques for aggregating and filtering data (GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions).
Joins between multiple tables to merge athlete and performance data.
Conditional queries and subqueries to handle complex conditions (e.g., consecutive wins, multi-medal analysis).
Text aggregation for managing tied results.
Outcome
This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL for exploring multi-dimensional datasets, 
extracting insights, and answering complex queries. It highlights capabilities in sports 
data analytics and understanding historical performance trends in the Olympics.
